# Financial Engineering Graduate Program Projects

This repository contains coursework, group work projects (GWPs), and applied notebooks completed as part of my graduate-level Financial Engineering program. The work integrates mathematical finance, statistics, machine learning, and software implementation, with an emphasis on translating theory into practical financial models.

Projects are organized by subject area, with each folder corresponding to a core course or module in the program.
